## 👋 Hi there!

I'm Nozaki Yuu! Actually I'm not the "real" Nozaki Yuu at the image above that was came from an anime, but I treated her as my waifu so I set the GitHub username into this one!<br>
Apart from Nozaki Yuu, I also have other nicknames such as Rink4, Meir, Nico Levianth, LilShieru (*my old GitHub username*) and Serena1432! You can call me whatever name you want but I'd rather be called by these names above.

## 👤 Who am I?

I'm a independent and ordinary software developer that has been learning how to code since 2015 (that has been 7 years!) and I have actually made some softwares and tools for some people.<br>
Although I have been learning how to code for 7 years until now, but I am still a beginner and I need to learn more. If you want to help me, feel free to send a message to one of my Social Networks! I'll be very happy! 😄

## Plans
Currently I'm revising my knowledge to prepare for 3 next exams in September, December and next year, so I paused all of my coding plans just to focus more on studying.

*More parts are being updated, I just don't have time to write all of these today*
